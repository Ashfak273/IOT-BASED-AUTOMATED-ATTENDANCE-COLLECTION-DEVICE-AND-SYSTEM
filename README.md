# IOT-BASED-AUTOMATED-ATTENDANCE-COLLECTION-DEVICE-AND-SYSTEM

Welcome to the "IOT-BASED-AUTOMATED-ATTENDANCE-COLLECTION-DEVICE-AND-SYSTEM" repository! This project focuses on an innovative solution for automated attendance collection using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Below, you'll find an overview of the contents and how to navigate the repository.

## Contents

### 1. Tested Codes

Explore the `Tested_Codes` directory to find code implementations related to the automated attendance collection system. The codes have been thoroughly tested and documented for ease of use.

### 2. Prototypes

The `Prototypes` folder contains information and documentation related to the hardware and software prototypes developed for the automated attendance system. This includes details on components, connections, and assembly instructions.

### 3. CAD Designs

Find detailed CAD designs and schematics in the `CAD_Designs` directory. These designs provide a visual representation of the physical components used in the system.

### 4. Presentation Slides

View the `Presentation_Slides` folder for presentation slides that provide an overview of the project, its objectives, methodologies, and results. These slides can be used for educational or presentation purposes.

## How to Use

1. **Tested Codes:**
   - Navigate to the `Tested_Codes` directory to access the tested code implementations.
   - Follow the instructions in the README file within the respective code directories for setup and usage details.

2. **Prototypes:**
